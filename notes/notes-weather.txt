    * Display the current weather and forecast. Rip off iOS. Smoke a blunt before you do this, it's busy-work.

TODO

Construct the URL to send to the API on the frontend, THEN send it to the back.
    CAN'T. You get the ip address on the backend. That's where you have to build the URL.
Find a better way to handle the data flow / global variables.
Don't do a fetch request if the input is invalid.
Show the user if their input is valid while they're typing.

MAYBE

    Limit the number of requests that can be made so you don't get in trouble with the API.
    Have all forecast requests go through the same function.
    userAttemptedCoordinates: tell the user the format of their coordinates was wrong.

SCRATCH

If the coordinates are valid, return forecast for that.
Otherwise, return a list of possibilities and the forecast for the first item on the list. Let the user select.

Be goal-oriented and treat her like a customer: "Erin, your huffing is really distracting. If you can't stop, it's alright, I'll move to another room."
Why is everything so deeply offensive to her? I feel like I couldn't move without upsetting her unless I had a really good reason. I couldn't just do it because I wanted to.
