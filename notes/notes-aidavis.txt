AIDAVIS.XYZ NOTES

    * I'm Aidan. I make websites. <Linkedin> <Github>
    * Have the word "websites" highlighted. Hovering or clicking triggers a drop-down with titles and previews.
    * Everything involving filepaths should be relative so that it's easy to move things around.

When the user requests weather and there are multiple possible locations, return the list and let them click on the one they want.
Maybe also have a search function on your page.

Make sure all sites work on chrome, edge, safari, and firefox.

Put on github.
